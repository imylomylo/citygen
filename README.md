# citygen

I got curious for a proof of concept and found [this threejs city generator by Carson Britt](https://codepen.io/pieceoftoast/pen/ojVWdR).
2 hours later i had it working standalone and with a komodoseed url variable.

From the Komodo discord's #dev-games channel, @Regnar linked to [medieval toy town generator](https://watabou.itch.io/toy-town) over the weekend which had me thinking how to integrate with oracles.

clone and just visit http://localhost/citygen?komodoseed=<SOMESEED>
The original used a number between 0 and 1.
I've tested with random strings and numbers.
